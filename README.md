# Welcome to Campus Cliq

## Project info 
The goal of this project is to explore more about web and app development ! The actual idea for the app came from an app called "Vibelink" from an intern I met at Capital One. Go check out Vibelink to see the real deal.

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```
