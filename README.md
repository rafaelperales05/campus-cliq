# Welcome to Campus Cliq

## Project info 
The goal of this project is to modernize social clubs on campus ! I want to make it easier for students to get involved, network, and make new friends. Where does the modernize part fit in then ? We want to create AI agents that network for you. Interested in a different major, want to find a co-founder, want to make friends, or even just embarassed to go to a new club by yourself ? Ask an ai agent to auto connect you with other students. 

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```
